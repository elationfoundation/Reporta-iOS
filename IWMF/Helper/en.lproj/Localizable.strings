You can categorize your contacts into three distinct Circles.\n\nPRIVATE CIRCLE\nYour Private Circle is the group of contacts with whom you are closest and those who will take action on your behalf if needed. There is no limit to the number of contacts you designate in this group, but these contacts are usually your closest associates, family members or colleagues, such as your editor, partner or a sibling.\n\nIf you are adding individuals to this Circle, you should provide them with instructions, preferably written, about what to do if alerted by Reporta. You will want these contacts to know what to do if you have missed a Check-in, sent an Alert, or activated an SOS.\n\nTo use Reporta, you must designate at least one contact in your Private Circle to serve as your App-Unlock contact. App-Unlock contacts will receive a link to a verification code required to unlock the app if you miss a Check-in or issue an SOS. You may add as many App-Unlock contacts as you wish, but a designated App-Unlock contact must be included in your Private Circle.\n\nOnce locked, you will not be able to access the app on your phone until you have the App-Unlock code. There is no other way to unlock the app.\n\nYou may create more than one Private Circle, but only one Private Circle can be active at any given time. You may choose to create different Private Circles based on the story you are covering or where you are working.\n\nFor you convenience, Reporta will ask you if you want to update your Circles when you travel 100 miles or more from the last place you used the app.\n\nPUBLIC CIRCLE\nYour Public Circle is a group of individuals or organizations that may be interested in your security. This may include journalism associations, unions or media organizations. You may create more than one Public Circle, but only one Public Circle can be active at any given time. Creating a Public Circle is not required to use Reporta.\n\nSOCIAL CIRCLE\nYou can connect Reporta to your Facebook and Twitter accounts. Note that anything you post to social media through Reporta can be seen by others.";
